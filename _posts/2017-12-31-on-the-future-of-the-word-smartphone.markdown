When do we stop calling it a `smartphone` and just refer to it as a `phone` always? I'm ready now. At this point, the qualifier only matters if the device is **_not_** a `smartphone`. Let's call `non-smartphones` `oldphones`, and make `phones` the new default for `smartphones`. It's not fair to call `oldphones` `dumbphones`, because some of the `oldphones` are actually pretty sophisticated.
